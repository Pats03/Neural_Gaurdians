NeuralGuardians ‚Äì Agentic AI Smart Incident Responder
üöÄ Overview

NeuralGuardians is an Agentic AI-powered cyber incident response system that detects, analyzes, and responds to suspicious activities in real-time.
It autonomously protects logins, file access, and fake account creation while providing clear AI-generated reports to admins.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon to showcase the future of AI-driven cybersecurity.

‚ú® Novelty

Agentic AI Workflow: Uses LangGraph to chain specialized AI agents (Detector ‚Üí Analyzer ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Reporter).

Autonomous Defense: Detects threats and auto-blocks malicious users or sessions in real time.

Adaptive Detection: Learns from user login patterns, file access history, and bot behaviors.

Smart Reporting: AI-generated human-readable reports help admins take quick actions.

Hybrid Storage: Combines Redis for real-time counters and MongoDB for persistent incident history.

Email Alerts: Sends warning emails to users (via Gmail or RapidAPI) if login attempts exceed threshold.

üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend

React.js + TailwindCSS

ThunderClient / Postman for API testing

Backend

Python Flask

LangGraph (Agent Orchestration)

Ollama (Local AI models e.g., Mistral, Llama3)

Databases

Redis ‚Üí Fast counters (failed logins, file downloads)

MongoDB ‚Üí Persistent storage of users, incidents, and reports

Other Tools

dotenv for environment variables

‚ö° Problem-Solution Fit

Problem: Increasing cyberattacks like brute-force logins, unauthorized file access, and fake account creation are difficult to monitor manually.

Solution: NeuralGuardians provides an autonomous AI-powered SOC assistant that:

Detects anomalies in login attempts.

Monitors and blocks sensitive file access.

Flags fake or bot accounts.

Provides real-time dashboards and AI reports for admins.

üîç API Routes
Auth

POST /register ‚Üí Register new user

POST /login ‚Üí Login user

Incidents

POST /incident ‚Üí Send login/file access event for analysis

GET /incidents ‚Üí Get all incidents

GET /incidents/<username> ‚Üí Get incidents of specific user

GET /failed-logins ‚Üí Get failed login history

GET /file-access ‚Üí Get suspicious file access history

Analytics

üìä Scalability & Impact

Can be scaled into a full SOC assistant for enterprises.

Pluggable with SIEM systems for real-world deployment.

Reduces response time from hours to milliseconds.

Protects against insider threats, brute-force attacks, and malicious file downloads.

- **neural_frontend/**: UI client side  
- **.gitignore**: files/folders ignored by Git

## Dependencies

You need to install dependencies for both backend and frontend parts.

### Backend

- Python (version ‚â• 3.x)  
- Some Python packages: (examples) Flask / Django / FastAPI / others (depending on which framework used)  
- Possibly ML / deep-learning libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or others.  
- Other utilities (e.g. for data processing, maybe database driver)  

### Frontend

- Node.js (version ‚â• 14 or 16, depending)  
- Package manager: npm or yarn  
- Frontend framework (React / Vue / Angular / plain JS)  
- Other JS dependencies (CSS frameworks, build tools, etc.)  

---

## Setup / Installation

> These instructions assume you have `git`, `python`, `node` installed on your machine.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pats03/Neural_Gaurdians.git
   cd Neural_Gaurdians/Backend
python3 -m venv venv        # or: python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flask  # and other packages
cd ../neural_frontend
npm install
npm start
Running the Project

With both backend and frontend set up:

Start the backend server:

cd Backend
source venv/bin/activate        # if not already active
# or on Windows activate venv as earlier
python app.py                    # or whatever the entry point is


Alternatively, if using Flask:

export FLASK_APP=app.py         # on macOS/Linux
set FLASK_APP=app.py            # on Windows CMD
flask run


Note: the port (default is often 5000) and host might be configurable.

Start the frontend server:

cd neural_frontend
npm start


Visit the frontend in your browser:

Usually at http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port your frontend dev server uses).
The frontend will make API calls to the backend (e.g. localhost:5000) ‚Äî might need to configure CORS or proxy.

Environment Variables / Configuration

You may need to set up some environment / config values, such as:

Variable	Purpose / What to set
FLASK_APP or similar	Points to the main backend file (e.g. app.py)
FLASK_ENV	Development vs production mode (e.g. development)
API_BASE_URL or frontend config	URL of backend server for API calls
Database credentials, if used	
Secret keys (if authentication is involved)	

You can create a .env file in the backend root (and possibly in frontend) and load these with dotenv or equivalent.
Troubleshooting / FAQ

If you get a module not found error in backend ‚Üí ensure you installed all required packages and the virtual environment is activated.

If frontend cannot communicate with backend ‚Üí check the API base URL / CORS settings.

Port conflicts ‚Üí change port via command line or config.

If static assets or missing files error ‚Üí check that the frontend build / public folder is correct.
